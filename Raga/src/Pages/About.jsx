            <h1>Decrypting RagaCrypt</h1>
            <p>
              RagaCrypt is an educational and practical tool built to explore
              the art and science of encryption and decryption. Designed for
              students, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts, it showcases
              how both classical and modern cryptographic algorithms protect
              data in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
              From simple Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers to robust AES and RSA
              encryption, users can encode and decode messages using
              customizable key-based techniques. Whether you're learning about
              secure communication or experimenting with cipher logic, RagaCrypt
              provides a hands-on, intuitive interface for deeper understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project highlights the critical role of cryptography in
              privacy, secure messaging, and modern information security. We
              believe knowledge of cryptography is essential in today‚Äôs digital
              age ‚Äî and RagaCrypt is your gateway to it.
